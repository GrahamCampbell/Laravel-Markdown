## What Is Laravel Markdown?

Laravel Markdown is a simple [PHP Markdown Next](https://github.com/nazar-pc/php-markdown-next) wrapper for [Laravel 4.1](http://laravel.com).

* Laravel Markdown was created by, and is maintained by [Graham Campbell](https://github.com/GrahamCampbell).
* Laravel Markdown relies on Nazar Mokrynskyi's [PHP Markdown Next](https://github.com/nazar-pc/php-markdown-next) package.
* Laravel Markdown uses [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/GrahamCampbell/Laravel-Markdown) with [Coveralls](https://coveralls.io/r/GrahamCampbell/Laravel-Markdown) to check everything is working.
* Laravel Markdown uses [Scrutinizer CI](https://scrutinizer-ci.com/g/GrahamCampbell/Laravel-Markdown) and [SensioLabsInsight](https://insight.sensiolabs.com/projects/15243b7d-e94d-45b6-a761-2a9dfb153b1f) to run additional checks.
* Laravel Markdown uses [Composer](https://getcomposer.org) to load and manage dependencies.
* Laravel Markdown provides a [change log](https://github.com/GrahamCampbell/Laravel-Markdown/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md), [releases](https://github.com/GrahamCampbell/Laravel-Markdown/releases), and [api docs](http://grahamcampbell.github.io/Laravel-Markdown).
* Laravel Markdown is licensed under the Apache License, available [here](https://github.com/GrahamCampbell/Laravel-Markdown/blob/master/LICENSE.md).


## System Requirements

* PHP 5.4.7+ or PHP 5.5+ is required.
* You will need [Laravel 4.1](http://laravel.com) because this package is designed for it.
* You will need [Composer](https://getcomposer.org) installed to load the dependencies of Laravel Markdown.


## Installation

Please check the system requirements before installing Laravel Markdown.

To get the latest version of Laravel Markdown, simply require it in your `composer.json` file.

`"graham-campbell/markdown": "dev-master"`

You'll then need to run `composer install` or `composer update` to download it and have the autoloader updated.

Once Laravel Markdown is installed, you need to register the service provider. Open up `app/config/app.php` and add the following to the `providers` key.

* `'GrahamCampbell\Markdown\MarkdownServiceProvider'`

You can register the Markdown facade in the `aliases` key of your `app/config/app.php` file if you like.

* `'Markdown' => 'GrahamCampbell\Markdown\Facades\Markdown'`


## Configuration

Laravel Markdown requires no configuration. Just follow the simple install instructions and go!


## Usage

There is currently no usage documentation besides the [API Documentation](http://grahamcampbell.github.io/Laravel-Markdown
) for Laravel Markdown.

You may see an example of implementation in [CMS Core](https://github.com/GrahamCampbell/CMS-Core).


## Updating Your Fork

Before submitting a pull request, you should ensure that your fork is up to date.

You may fork Laravel Markdown:

    git remote add upstream git://github.com/GrahamCampbell/Laravel-Markdown.git

The first command is only necessary the first time. If you have issues merging, you will need to get a merge tool such as [P4Merge](http://perforce.com/product/components/perforce_visual_merge_and_diff_tools).

You can then update the branch:

    git pull --rebase upstream master
    git push --force origin <branch_name>

Once it is set up, run `git mergetool`. Once all conflicts are fixed, run `git rebase --continue`, and `git push --force origin <branch_name>`.


## Pull Requests

Please review these guidelines before submitting any pull requests.

* When submitting bug fixes, check if a maintenance branch exists for an older series, then pull against that older branch if the bug is present in it.
* Before sending a pull request for a new feature, you should first create an issue with [Proposal] in the title.
* Please follow the [PSR-2 Coding Style](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-2-coding-style-guide.md) and [PHP-FIG Naming Conventions](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/bylaws/002-psr-naming-conventions.md).
